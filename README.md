As a Math and computer Science student at the faculty of science of Tunis. I created a Program that will summarize and use all what we learned throught the semestere using python language.

CandyMath was a simple idea that can combine Mathematics and computer science. I used different modules like maths algorithms, file manipulation and graphs drawing in this Project. What pushed me more to create this program is it's ability to be developped into machine learning and have better chances to solve different maths equations. Not only pre-programmed ones.

# Operating System compatibale:

CandyMath works perfectly on GUI/LINUX and MAC OS.

Run CandyMath_Windows.py for windows users.. (if you had any problem in this version please contact me)
