# CandyMath
As a Math and computer Science student at the faculty of science of Tunis. I had to create a Program that will summarize and use all what we learned throught the semestere using python language.

CandyMath was a simple idea that can combine Mathematics and computer science. I used different modules like maths algorithms, file manipulation and graphs drawing in this Project. What pushed me more to create this program is it's ability to be developped into machine learning and have better chances to solve different maths equations. Not only pre-programmed ones.

# Operating System compatibale:
